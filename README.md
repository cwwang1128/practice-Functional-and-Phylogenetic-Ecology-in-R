# practice-Functional-and-Phylogenetic-Ecology-in-R

When I was a 1st-year master student, I read 'Functional and Phylogenetic Ecology in R.'
Meanwhile, I did some practice following the book. 

If you want to do some exercises and to read this book, here is the link to the book: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-9542-0

Enjoy~
